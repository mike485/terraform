Google Cloud Infrastructure via Terraform
This repository contains the Terraform configuration files required to provision and manage foundational infrastructure resources within Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

By using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), this project ensures that the environment is fully reproducible, version-controlled, and easily maintainable.

🚀 Architecture Overview
The Terraform code in this repository automates the deployment of the following core GCP components:

Identity & Access Management (IAM): Service accounts and granular role assignments ensuring the principle of least privilege.

Networking (VPC): Custom VPC networks, subnets, firewall rules, and Cloud NAT configurations.

Compute & Containers: Provisioning of managed resources (e.g., GKE clusters or Compute Engine instances).

Storage & Databases: Secure Cloud Storage buckets and managed database instances (such as Cloud Spanner or Cloud SQL).
